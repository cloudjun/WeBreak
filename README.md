# WeBreak
wechat message collector

This is a side project that I created quite sometime ago to capture every chat message that appears in your WeChat App. It was actually up in Microsoft Azure with the Chrome extension, the backend listener and SignalR to push realtime messages to the WeBreak website, but it was not maintained somehow due to various reasons.

Here is a unfinished roadmap overview, I might pick it up again if the need rises.
